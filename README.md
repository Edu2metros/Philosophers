<h2 align="center"><strong>What is the Philosophers?</strong></h2>

Philosophers is a project that aims to solve the dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes. The dining philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem that models a dining room with five philosophers sitting around a circular table doing one of three things: eating, thinking, or sleeping. The philosophers must never be starving, and they must never be deadlocked.
